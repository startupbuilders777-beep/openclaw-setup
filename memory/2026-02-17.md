# Daily Memory - 2026-02-17

## System Audit Completed

### What We Fixed Today

1. **GitHub Repo Cleanup**
   - Created `superclaw` repo with agents + skills
   - Renamed `reddit-automarket` → `openclaw-system`
   - Updated superclaw description

2. **Stale Processes**
   - Killed 4 stale `next dev` processes from Feb 16
   - Freeing ~500MB RAM

3. **MEMORY.md Updated**
   - Current projects, repos, Asana GIDs
   - Agent architecture documented

### Critical Finding: CRON JOBS NOT RUNNING

**The Brutal Truth:**
- HEARTBEAT.md describes cron jobs that SHOULD run
- Agent prompts say "You run automatically on cron"
- BUT: **No actual cron jobs are configured in the gateway**

**What's Actually Running:**
- Gateway is alive
- Discord routing is configured
- Agents exist but only respond when messaged
- No automatic 24/7 execution

**Why:**
- Cron jobs were never added via `cron add` command
- The gateway has cron enabled but empty
- We're manually triggering work instead of autonomous

### What Needs Fixing

1. Add cron jobs to gateway for:
   - Forge (builder): Every 30 min - pick Asana tasks, build
   - Sage (PM): Every 1 hour - triage, add tasks
   - Check (QA): Every 1 hour - review code
   - Deploy: Every 2 hours - deploy

2. Set up proper 24/7 pipeline

### Projects Status

| Project | Asana Tasks | Building? |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| SuperClaw | 58 incomplete | ❌ Not started |
| AgentWatch | ~7 | ❌ Not building |
| NexusAI | ~4 | ❌ Not building |
| SafeAgent | ~9 | ❌ Not building |
| RedditAutoMarket | 2 | ❌ Blocked on deployment |

**None of the projects are being built automatically.**

## Action Items
- [ ] Add cron jobs to gateway
- [ ] Verify agents pick up Asana tasks automatically
- [ ] Test the full 24/7 loop
